I am an Associate Professor in Philosophy of Language at the University of Cagliari and Fellow of the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities and the Social Sciences, Amsterdam.

After completion of the MA in Philosophy at the University of Padua and the Ph.D. in Philosophy at the Roma Tre University (Italy), I worked as a postdoc researcher at the Department of Linguistics, University College London (UK) and the Institut Jean Nicod, Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris (France).
